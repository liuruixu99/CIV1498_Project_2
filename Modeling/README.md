## Description of the folder
This folder includes a total of four python files. One file is for feature selection and three files are for modeling different types of trips.

## Description of each file
Step_6: selecting features for predicting each type of trip based on the F-test
Step_7: models that predict total number of trips based on the full dataset (including both the weather data and temporal data)
Step_8: models that predict number of trips by the annual members based on the full dataset
Step_9: models that predict number of trips by the casual users based on the full dataset
Step_10: models that predict total number of trips based on the weather dataset only
Step_11: models that predict number of trips by the annual members based on the weather dataset only
Step_12: models that predict number of trips by the casual users based on the weather dataset only
Step_13: models that predict total number of trips based on the temporal data only
Step_14: models that predict number of trips by the annual members based on the temporal data only
Step_15: models that predict number of trips by the casual users based on the temporal data only
